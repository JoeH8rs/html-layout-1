	I'll protect you from the hooded claw.
Keep the vampires from your door.

Feels like fire,
I'm so in love with you.
Dreams are like angels,
they keep bad at bay-bad at bay.
Love is the light
Scaring darkness away-yeah.

I'm so in love with you,
purge the soul
Make love your goal. The power of love
a force from above,
cleaning my soul.
Flame on burn desire,
love with tongues of fire,
purge the soul,
make love your goal.

I'll protect you from the hooded claw
Keep the vampires from your door
When the chips are down I'll be around,
with my undying, death-defying
Love for you.
